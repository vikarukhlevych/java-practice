Abstraction

Abstraction is something not concrete. 

Let's say we have an Animal, Animal it's a generic name.

But cat is an animal, and cat is something concrete.

OOP 
	Encapsulation
	Inheritance
	Abstraction

If we want to create an abstract class, we use keyword abstract.
We need abstract class to create abstract methods.

We must implement abstract methods in the sub-class.

//		Animal animal = new Animal(); Cannot instantiate the type Animal

Because Animal is an abstract class, we cannot create an object of this class.

#################################

Abstract class -> Concrete class (regular non-abstract class).
A concrete class is the one from which you can create an instance (object).

we use  keyword abstract to make class abstract
An then, we can have abstract methods inside.

non-abstract class can extend abstract class
abstract class can extend other abstract class

If abstract class, extends other abstract class, child class is not responsible for implementation abstract methods. But, concrete class must implement all abstract methods.

You cannot make abstract method final.

Child abstract class can implement parent abstract methods.

Static method cannot be overridden, and cannot be abstract.

Abstract method cannot be final, static and private. 

Abstraction: it provides an idea of what object can do, and it doesn't define how it functions.

Abstract class can be sub-classed but cannot be instantiated.

Keyword abstract can be applied to the method and class only.

You cannot have abstract variable.

#################Task 1########################

1,Create a Shape abstract class

2,create instance fields: name, area (double);

3,create 2 abstract method as below :
calculateArea() return double, no arg
draw() void 

4,create one constructor that set name-value

5,Create Circle and Triangle Concrete classes of Shape

5.1,create no arg constructor and call super class's 
one arg constructor
for Circle add 1 arg to set radius,Triangle 3 args 
set length

6,In Circle class add radius field. 
and use this field to calculate your area in your calculateArea() method

7,in Triangle class add leng1,leng2,leng3 and calculate your area according to the each side of triangle.

9, Implement the abstract methods in both class
